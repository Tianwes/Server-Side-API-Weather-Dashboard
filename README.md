# Server-Side-API-Weather-Dashboard
Real time weather dashboard

## What to expect
- !! Code has a function at the top (getStoredObj())- this obstructs the code until there is a city in local storage

- When user inputs a city into the search bar,
a main div should display the current weather aspects for that city, 
including a uv card color indicating the UV safety level,
while, a set of five-day-forecast cards should display below.
Cities that have been searched will appear under the search bar,
most recent will appear at the top.
